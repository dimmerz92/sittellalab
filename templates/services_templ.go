In line with this specialisation, we do not offer any user interface, user experience, or graphic design services, however, we are more than happy to work with your team or design(ers) to achieve what you need.</p><p>At Sittella Lab, we are most comfortable implementing our solutions in a technical stack that uses the languages Go, htmx, and JavaScript. We are also more than happy to implement solutions using other tech stacks such as Next, React, and Svelte.</p></div></div><div class=\"item\"><div class=\"title\"><h3>Database Development</h3><img src=\"/static/imgs/database.svg\" alt=\"database icon\"></div><div><h4>What does this mean?</h4><p>Databases are used to store user generated data in a persistent way. Without a database, any data generated through your website will be lost in the event that the website goes down, or when the user navigates away. This is fine if the data generated does not need to be stored, however, a more common scenario is that of data requiring persistence such as user information & credentials, videos, images, etc.</p><p>Sittella Lab specialises in the implementation of relational database management systems. We can help you define your business logic, design a relational database schema that conforms to the requirements, and implement the schema in a desired relational database language.</p><p>We are most comfortable using technologies like SQLite and Postgre depending on the requirements, however, SQL is a well defined standard, with many of the relational database vendors closely implementing this, we are happy to work whatever relational database system you may already have. Due to our data anayltics background, we are far more likely to recommend a relational database over other databases like document or graph based databases. We are happy to discuss your requirements.</p></div></div><div class=\"item\"><div class=\"title\"><h3>Domains & Hosting</h3><img src=\"/static/imgs/hosting.svg\" alt=\"hosting icon\"></div><div><h4>What does this mean?</h4><p>For the purposes of a web site, a domain can be considered analogous to the web address. For example, the domain for this website is sittellalab.com.au. A domain can be acquired from a vendor known as a domain name registrar. Sittella Lab can help you determine what you want your domain name to be and assist in the acquisition of a domain name through a registrar.</p><p>Hosting a website can range from extremely simple through to complex, depending on the requirements and specifications of the website. A host is where your web application can be set up and made publicly accessible so that users can interact with your website. Sittella Lab can assist you in figuring out your hosting requirements, deploy your web site into production, and can even help you with ongoing hosting and maintainence issues.</p></div></div><a class=\"cta-button\" style=\"background: var(--blue); justify-self: center;\" href=\"/contact\">Send an enquiry</a></section><section id=\"data-analytics\"><h2>Data Analytics Services</h2><div class=\"item\"><div class=\"title\"><h3>Data Exploration & Visualisation</h3><img src=\"/static/imgs/chart.svg\" alt=\"chart icon\"></div><div><h4>What does this mean?</h4><p>Leveraging data to drive informed decision making in your business can be the difference between failure, survival, and thriving.</p><p>Sittella Lab can assist you to explore and visualise data.
